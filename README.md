# ReadLater Chrome Extension
A Chrome Extension that is way better than bookmarks! 


## Purpose

Have you ever bookmarked something, went to view it and then never deleted the bookmark? Me too, so I created ReadLater, a simple Chrome extension that lets you save websites to view later, it automatically removes the links you clicked!
